# MacNewFile

One of the many things that pissed me off after switching from Windows to Mac was that I couldn't create a new text file or word document off of a right click in Finder (file explorer).

So I fixed that! Introducing **MacNewFile**!!

MacNewFile is very lightweight and simple. You right click anywhere in Finder (or on your desktop) and you get a menu to create new files!
